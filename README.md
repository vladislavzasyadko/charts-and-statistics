## A Chart JS project

This App is getting data from [here](https://github.com/kirillzorin/internship2020/blob/master/data.json) and parsing it into individual data arrays by chosen category.

* If the last value fo the chart is bigger than the first one - the chart is green, otherwise - it's red.
* Minimal value is marked red, maximum - green, the last one is blue.
* Hovering the chart shows the average value of the hovered chart.
* Clicking the chart scales all charts to the size of the chart that User clicked. Second click scales all charts back to normal
